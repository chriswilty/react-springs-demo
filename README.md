# React Springs: Demo with React Hooks

Some wonderful animations can be achieved using just CSS, more still with a sprinkling of
javascript. But when CSS can no longer cope, libraries such as
[react-spring](https://react-spring.surge.sh/) can take over.

In simplest of terms, `react-spring` smooths transition of a value from _A_ to _B_.
While this might not sound like a big deal, all you need to worry about is start and end values,
and `react-spring` will transition the value smoothly. Your React component does not need to
re-render whenever the value updates during that transition; you can choose to animate your
DOM elements using CSS transforms instead, which lessens the burden on React.

This repo is my playground for `react-spring` and as such is eternally a work-in-progress :)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
